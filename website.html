            <h1 style="color: black;"> Welcome to Bidhan Chandra College</h1><br>
            <p>Bidhan Chandra College, Rishra, affiliated to the University of Culcatta, is situated in the heart of the
                industrial belt in the Serampore Sub-Division of Hoogly District in W.B. It was established in 1957
                after the name of illustrious Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, the then Chief Minister and architect of modern
                West Bengal. The college owes its existence to the munificient charity of Birkmyre Education Trust as
                also to the well wisher of the college like Late Shribhusan Bose, Late Pannalal Mukherjee, Late
                Principal Kanai LAl Ganguly and others who made laudable efforts in its making.



                The in-campus setting of the institution immediately nullifies the din and bustle of the busy G.T. Road
                and its surrounding. The moment one crosses the main entrance of the college, it becomes impossible for
                him or her to fight shy of the refreshing ambience-an ambience with a panoramic view of the holy
                Bhagirathi with a strand line stretching over around hundred meters covered with amazing lush foliage
                which virtually transforms the campus into an emerald idyllic aura.



                The intermingling of students of various shades of classes, castes and communities and of various
                languages, religions and cultures coming from Rishra and adjancent localities, even from distant rural
                areas, helps to develop a healthy broad culture in the campus life.



                Moreover, the notable features of the institution is the influx of a large number of the first
                generation learners and some of them have shown outstanding performances in their respective
                professionsl lives.
            </p><br>
            <h3>
                Aim and Objective</h3><br>
            <p>The aim of the institution is to impart sound education by developing in the students habits of piety,
                accountability, discipline and self-reliance during the year of their studies.



                The objective of this institution is to hone the academic and extra-academic potential of the students
                enabling them to cope with unforeseeable future of their lives.</p><br>
            <h3>Mission and Motto</h3><br>
            <p>
                The mission of the institution is to develop among the students, coming up from different casts, creed
                and culture, a harmonions and integrated personality and a sense of cosmopolitanism thereby reflecting a
                collective ethos of our nation.



                The emblem of the college, printed on the front cover of the prospectus, has sincerely been selected to
                represent the motto of the college. The earthen flaming-torch on a dark backdrop symbolises an endeavour
                to make a journey from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge and wisdom (Tomosa Ma
                Jyotirgamaya).
